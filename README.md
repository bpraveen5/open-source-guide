## 🧱 Step-by-Step Contribution Plan

### 🧩 Step 1: Choose Your Technology

Start with what you already know:

* Java / Spring Boot
* JavaScript / React
* Python
* HTML / CSS
* Documentation (Markdown)

> 💡 Even documentation contributions are **valid and valuable**.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Find Open Source Projects

You can discover projects using:

* GitHub Explore → [https://github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore)
* GitHub topic search (`java`, `spring-boot`, `react`)
* Beginner labels:

  * `good first issue`
  * `beginner`
  * `help wanted`

---

### 📖 Step 3: Understand the Project

Before coding:

* Read `README.md`
* Check folder structure
* Review `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Learn how to run the project locally

> ❌ Never start coding without understanding the project.

---

### 🐞 Step 4: Pick an Issue

* Open the **Issues** tab
* Choose beginner‑friendly issues
* Prefer issues with clear description

Comment on the issue:

> Hi, I would like to work on this issue. Please assign it to me.

---

### 🍴 Step 5: Fork the Repository

* Click **Fork** on GitHub
* A copy of the repository is created under your account

---

### 💻 Step 6: Clone Repository Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

---

### 🌿 Step 7: Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b fix-login-bug
```

> Always work on a **feature branch**, never on `main`.

---

### 🛠️ Step 8: Write Code / Fix Issue

* Follow coding standards
* Keep changes small and clean
* Add comments where needed
* Update documentation if required

---

### 🧪 Step 9: Test Your Changes

* Run the project locally
* Fix errors and warnings
* Ensure nothing breaks

---

### 📝 Step 10: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation issue"
```

Commit message should be **clear and meaningful**.

---

### ⬆️ Step 11: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin fix-login-bug
```

---

### 🔁 Step 12: Create Pull Request (PR)

* Click **Compare & Pull Request**
* Clearly explain:

  * What you changed
  * Why you changed it

Example:

> Fixed login validation bug by adding null checks and error handling.

---

### 👀 Step 13: Review & Feedback

Maintainers may:

* Request changes
* Suggest improvements
* Approve the PR

Respond politely and update your code if required.

---

### 🎉 Step 14: PR Merged – You Are a Contributor!

* Your code becomes part of the project
* Your name appears in contributors list
* Congratulations 🎊
